List of books I have read so far in 2019

[The Black Swan](https://www.worldcat.org/title/black-swan-the-impact-of-the-highly-improbable/oclc/1080191944&referer=brief_results) by Nassim Nicholas Taleb

This book by Taleb has allowed me to question a lot of "success" people has that could also easily be attributed to luck. Also, many humans (including myself) are prone to the triplet of opacity and platonifying.
